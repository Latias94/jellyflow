# Jellyflow Package Split v1

Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-05-30

## Problem

`fret-node` currently means both reusable node graph substrate and Fret UI integration. That makes
the headless story harder to teach, and it makes future standalone extraction harder than it needs
to be.

## Target State

Jellyflow is the reusable node/flow graph engine brand. `fret-node` remains the Fret adapter and
compatibility facade.

The intended package stack is:

1. `jellyflow-core`: graph document model, IDs, type descriptors, interaction policy value types,
   and transaction ops/history helpers.
2. `jellyflow-runtime`: headless I/O/view-state payloads, rules, schema/profile pipeline,
   store/apply/callback/controlled-mode substrate built on the headless core transaction model.
3. `jellyflow-geometry`: geometry, spatial, path, and hit-test substrate once those seams are ready.
4. `fret-node`: Fret UI adapter, declarative surface, overlays, portals, diagnostics, app
   integration, and compatibility re-exports.

## In Scope

- New in-workspace Jellyflow crates under `ecosystem/`.
- Compatibility re-exports from `fret-node`.
- Dependency gates proving headless crates stay off UI, renderer, platform, and runner crates.
- ADR and usage-guide updates for the package ownership story.

## Out Of Scope

- Moving Jellyflow to a separate repository in this slice.
- Renaming every public `NodeGraph*` type.
- Moving declarative Fret UI, overlays, portals, or retained compatibility code into Jellyflow core.
- Adding a Jellyflow-owned wgpu renderer.

## First Slice

JF-001 creates `jellyflow-core`, moves `core`, `types`, and `interaction` into it, and leaves
`fret-node` wrapper modules so existing `fret_node::{core,types,interaction}` paths keep compiling.

JF-010 extends that core split by moving `ops` into `jellyflow-core` while keeping the
XyFlow-style change projection helpers in `fret-node` as adapter code.

JF-020 creates `jellyflow-runtime`, moves `io`, `profile`, `rules`, `schema`, and `runtime` into
it, and leaves `fret-node` wrapper modules so existing `fret_node::{io,profile,rules,schema,runtime}`
paths keep compiling.

JF-030 audited the geometry/spatial seam and decided not to extract `jellyflow-geometry` yet. The
current canvas-space geometry, spatial indexes, route math, and hit-test helpers remain adapter
code in `fret-node`; the reusable headless seam found in the audit is the fit-view math already
living in `jellyflow-runtime`.
