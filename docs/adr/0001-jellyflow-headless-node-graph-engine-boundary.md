# ADR 0001: Jellyflow Headless Node Graph Engine Boundary

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-05-29

## Context

`fret-node` began as the in-tree node graph foundation plus Fret UI integration surface. As the
declarative path matures, the crate now carries two different responsibilities:

- a portable node/flow graph engine that should be useful without Fret UI, renderers, or platform
  runners,
- the Fret adapter that maps that engine into `fret-ui`, `fret-canvas`, overlays, portals, focus,
  diagnostics, and app integration.

Keeping both meanings under the `fret-node` name makes headless use and future extraction less
obvious. It also makes dependency drift harder to audit: a headless consumer should not need to know
which modules are safe to use under `--no-default-features`.

## Decision

Introduce **Jellyflow** as the neutral engine brand for the reusable node/flow graph substrate.
`fret-node` remains the Fret ecosystem adapter and compatibility facade.

The split starts inside this monorepo. We do not move Jellyflow to a separate repository until the
crate boundaries and compatibility story have survived focused compile and behavior gates.

The intended package direction is:

- `jellyflow-core`: headless graph document model, stable IDs, type descriptors, and interaction
  policy value types.
- `jellyflow-runtime`: headless I/O/view-state payloads, rules, schema/profile pipeline,
  store/apply/callback/controlled-mode substrate.
- `jellyflow-geometry`: future headless geometry, spatial, path, and hit-test substrate when those
  contracts are ready to leave the Fret adapter.
- `jellyflow-fret` or `fret-node`: Fret UI adapter, controller/binding, declarative surface,
  overlays, portals, diagnostics, and compatibility re-exports.

`jellyflow-core` and `jellyflow-runtime` must stay free of `fret-core`, `fret-ui`,
`fret-runtime`, `fret-canvas`, `wgpu`, and `winit`. Fret renderer integration and Fret-specific
input/geometry conversions belong in the Fret adapter layer, not in the Jellyflow core.

## Consequences

- `fret-node` can keep existing user-facing paths by re-exporting Jellyflow modules during the
  transition.
- Headless consumers get a smaller compile target and a clearer dependency contract.
- Future repository extraction becomes mechanical only after the package boundaries stabilize.
- Some names will temporarily contain `NodeGraph*` even inside Jellyflow crates. Renaming those
  symbols is a separate API migration and should not block the first package split.

## Initial Implementation

The first slice creates `ecosystem/jellyflow-core` and moves the stable headless `core`, `types`,
and `interaction` modules there. `fret-node` now depends on `jellyflow-core` and keeps
compatibility wrapper modules for `fret_node::{core,types,interaction}`.

Core follow-on slice:

`ops` (graph transactions, history, fragment/diff/normalize helpers, and transaction sanity
checks) now lives in `ecosystem/jellyflow-core`. The XyFlow-style node/edge change projection
helpers now live in `ecosystem/jellyflow-runtime/src/runtime/changes.rs`, while `fret-node`
re-exports `jellyflow_core::ops` from `ecosystem/fret-node/src/ops/mod.rs` for compatibility.

Runtime follow-on slice:

`io`, `profile`, `rules`, `schema`, and `runtime` now live in `ecosystem/jellyflow-runtime`.
`fret-node` keeps compatibility wrapper modules for
`fret_node::{io,profile,rules,schema,runtime}`. `DataflowProfile` remains in the `fret-node` kit
layer instead of becoming part of the runtime crate.

Standalone-readiness follow-on:

`jellyflow-core` and `jellyflow-runtime` no longer depend on `fret-core`. `NodeGraphModifiers` is
owned by `jellyflow-core`, key-code persistence depends directly on `keyboard-types`, and fit-view
rect helpers use Jellyflow `CanvasRect`. `fret-node` keeps the Fret `Modifiers`/`Rect` conversions
at the adapter boundary.

The standalone-readiness lane also adds an external temp-project smoke gate that path-depends only
on `jellyflow-core` and `jellyflow-runtime`, runs `cargo check`, and rejects any transitive `fret`
or `fret-*` package in `cargo tree`.

Repository policy follow-on: create a new standalone Jellyflow repository with history-preserving
extraction as the next execution lane, but delay crates.io publishing until standalone metadata,
READMEs, CI, release configuration, and `cargo publish --dry-run` gates are in place.
